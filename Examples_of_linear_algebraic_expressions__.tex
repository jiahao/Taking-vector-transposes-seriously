Examples of linear algebraic expressions users expect to write include:

\begin{description}

\item{Inner product} $u^T v$, a scalar,
\item{Outer product} $u v^T$, a matrix,
\item{Quadratic form} $u^T A u$, a scalar,
\item{Bilinear form} $u^T A v$, a scalar,

\end{description}

The description of these quantities employ Householder notation~\cite{Householder1953,Householder1955}, a convention that is familiar to most, if not all, practitioners of numerical linear algebra today.
