  abstract = {Array theory combines APL with set theory, transfinite arithmetic, and operationally transformed functions to produce an axiomatic theory in which the theorems hold for all arrays having any finite number of axes of arbitrary countable ordinal lengths. The items of an array are again arrays. The treatment of ordinal numbers and letters is similar to Quine’s treatment of individuals in set theory. The theory is developed first as a theory of lists. This paper relates the theory to the eight axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, describes the structure of arrays, interprets empty arrays in terms of vector spaces, presents a system of axioms for certain properties of operations related to the APL function of reshaping, deduces a few hundred theorems and corollaries, develops an algebra for determining the behavior of operations applied to empty arrays, begins the axiomatic development of a replacement operator, and provides an informal account of unions. Cartesian products, Cartesian arrays, and outer, positional, separation, and reduction transforms.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to ensure the existence of an axiom system which---contrary to [2]---leads to a uniform behaviour of all generalized arrays including basic scalars with respect to the function seal (enclose). The extension described hereafter takes up most of the ideas laid down in [1], but deviates from them in some respects while including additional tools and concepts such as---canonical tree representation of arrays---virtual indexing (indexing outside the index domain of an array)---a new concept for indexing including---virtual indexing---slice indexing, based on the outer product with respect to catenation---path indexing---an operator called composition operator (a generalization of reduction)---composition of operatorsFurthermore, the paper includes as a substantial part a simulation of a model of extended APL, as seen from an algebraic point of view. The model, intended as a working tool, was developed by the author at the Berufsförderungswerk in Heidelberg, Germany, and is contained in a workspace called HEIDELTREE.On the following pages I state the essential ideas in an informal way giving examples rather than definitions, but including the motivations for the reasoning whenever feasible in short terms.},
